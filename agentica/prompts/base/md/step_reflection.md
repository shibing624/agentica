# Step Reflection

Please reflect before continuing:

1. **Information Evaluation**: What new information did I obtain? Is this information sufficient to answer the user's question?

2. **Strategy Check**: Is the current search strategy effective? Do I need to change keywords or search angle?

3. **Progress Assessment**: Should I continue searching, or is the information already sufficient to provide an answer?

**Important**: Avoid repeating the same searches. If two consecutive search results are similar, adjust your strategy or stop.
