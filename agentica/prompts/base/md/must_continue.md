# Task Incomplete Reminder

**WARNING: Detected that you may be ending without fully solving the problem.**

Please note:

1. **You MUST keep iterating** until the problem is completely solved

2. **Verify your work** - Ensure all tasks are completed

3. **Do NOT end prematurely** - Continue working until the problem is truly solved

If you believe you're done, explicitly state what your solution is and how it addresses the user's problem.
