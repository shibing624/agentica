**Agentica is a lightweight and powerful Python framework for building, managing, and deploying autonomous AI agents.**

Whether you're creating a simple chatbot, a complex research assistant, or a collaborative team of specialized agents, Agentica provides the tools and abstractions to get you there faster. Our developer-first approach simplifies advanced features like RAG, multi-agent workflows, and long-term memory, making them accessible to everyone.

## üöÄ Why Agentica?

*   **Developer-First API**: A simple, intuitive, and object-oriented interface that's easy to learn and a joy to use.
*   **Modular & Extensible**: Swap components like LLMs, memory backends, and vector stores with ease.
*   **Batteries-Included**: Comes with a rich set of built-in tools (Web Search, Code Interpreter, File I/O), memory types, and advanced RAG capabilities out of the box.
*   **Advanced Features, Simplified**: Effortlessly implement complex patterns like multi-agent collaboration (Teams), task decomposition (Workflows), and self-reflection.
*   **Production-Ready**: Deploy your agents via a command-line interface, a web UI, or as a service. Standardized tool integration with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is also supported.
*   **Optimized for Chinese**: First-class support for Chinese language users with dedicated documentation and examples.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **ü§ñ Core Agent Capabilities**: Build agents with sophisticated planning, reflection, short-term, and long-term memory, and robust tool-use abilities.
*   **üß© Advanced Orchestration**:
    *   **Multi-Agent Teams**: Create teams of specialized agents that collaborate to solve problems.
    *   **Workflows**: Decompose complex tasks into a series of steps executed by different agents or tools.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Rich Tooling Ecosystem**:
    *   An extensive collection of built-in tools (Web Search, OCR, Image Generation, Shell Commands).
    *   Easily create your own custom tools.
    *   First-class support for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for standardized tool integration.
*   **üìö Flexible RAG Pipeline**:
    *   Built-in knowledge base management and document parsing (PDFs, text).
    *   Hybrid retrieval strategies and result reranking for maximum accuracy.
    *   Integrations with popular libraries like LangChain and LlamaIndex.
*   **üåå Multi-Modal Support**: Build agents that can understand and generate text, images, audio, and video.
*   **üß† Broad LLM Compatibility**: Works with dozens of models from providers like OpenAI, Azure, Deepseek, Moonshot, Anthropic, ZhipuAI, Ollama, Together, and more.
*   ** Evolvable Agents**: Agents with reflection and memory augmentation capabilities that can evolve on their own.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

</div>

Agentica's modular design allows for maximum flexibility and scalability. At its core are the `Agent`, `Model`, `Tool`, and `Memory` components, which can be easily combined and extended to create powerful applications.

## üíæ Installation

```bash
pip install -U agentica
```

To install from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shibing624/agentica.git
cd agentica
pip install .
```

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1.  **Set up your API keys.** Create a file at `~/.agentica/.env` or set environment variables.

    ```shell
    # For Moonshot AI
    export MOONSHOT_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    # For ZhipuAI
    export ZHIPUAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    # For Search tools
    export SERPER_API_KEY="your-serper-api-key"
    ```

2.  **Run your first agent!** This example creates an agent that can check the weather.

```python
    from agentica import Agent, Moonshot, WeatherTool

    # Initialize an agent with a model and a weather tool
    weather_agent = Agent(
        model=Moonshot(), 
        tools=[WeatherTool()],
        # Give the agent a sense of time for questions like "tomorrow"
        add_datetime_to_instructions=True  
    )

    # Ask the agent a question
    weather_agent.print_response("What's the weather like in Beijing tomorrow?")
    ```

    **Output:**
    ```markdown
    The weather forecast for Beijing tomorrow is as follows:

    - Morning: Clear, temperature around 18¬∞C, light wind at 3 km/h.
    - Noon: Clear, temperature rises to 23¬∞C, wind at 6-7 km/h.
    - Evening: Clear, temperature drops slightly to 21¬∞C, strong wind at 35-44 km/h.
    - Night: Clear, temperature drops to 15¬∞C, wind at 32-39 km/h.

    No precipitation is expected throughout the day, and visibility is good. Please be mindful of the strong winds in the evening.
    ```

## üìñ Core Concepts

*   **Agent**: The central component that thinks, makes decisions, and performs actions. It ties together the model, tools, and memory.
*   **Model**: The "brain" of the agent. It's typically a Large Language Model (LLM) that powers the agent's reasoning capabilities.
*   **Tool**: A function or capability the agent can use to interact with the outside world (e.g., search the web, run code, access a database).
*   **Memory**: Allows the agent to remember past interactions (short-term) and store critical information for later recall (long-term).
*   **Knowledge**: An external knowledge source (like a collection of documents) that the agent can query using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
*   **Workflow/Team**: High-level constructs for orchestrating complex, multi-step tasks or managing collaboration between multiple agents.
